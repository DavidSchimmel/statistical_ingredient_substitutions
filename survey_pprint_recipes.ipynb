    "- filter out pairings where the substitution source is blacklisted\n",
    "  - blacklist contains all of:\n",
    "    - PASTA = [\"pasta\", \"noodle\"]\n",

    "- filter out pairings where the substitution source is among the very most common (w.r.t. the recipe dataset) ingredienst (assuming that they are relatively non-informative)\n",
    "- filter out pairings where either subsitution source or target are among the very rare ingredients\n",
    "- filter out very short recipes (fewer than 3 ingredients)\n",
    "- filter out all pairings where fewer than 3 recipes remained per substitution tuple\n",
    "- form the remaining pairings pick ~252\n",
    "- for those, select 3 recipes per substitution tuple where the ground trutch substitution was suggested by gismo\n",
    "- finally fill the set up by adding 2 more recipes per substitution tuple where the substitution was not recommended by gismo"
